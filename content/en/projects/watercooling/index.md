This project was about.. getting a silent PC up and running.

It went through 3 interactions, first one even included machining some aluminium, fun stuff.

It was beautiful and silent, but required lots of TLC.
Nowadays I run my PCs on mini ITX cases, easier to move around and maintain!

_Sometimes I do crazy stuff_
